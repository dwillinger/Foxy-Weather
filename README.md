# Foxy-Weather
Foxy weather is a simple Web Application for Firefox OS showing weather forecasts in several languages and a background image of the selected location. All accessible pages are in the main directory. The important functions are in js/myFunctions.js.

## Get it running

### Weather Forecast from OpenWeatherMap.org
You have to provide an API-KEY from OpenWeatherMap.org to make the forecast work. Get it from http://openweathermap.org. Add it to the URL set at variable openWeatherAPI in js/myFunctions.js.

### Background Pictures 
Foxy weather used to display background images from the selected location. They were loaded from [Panoramio](http://www.panoramio.com). Since Google ended the service there are no background images shown.
